# Multi-Class-Image-Classification
## Natural Image Classification (Kaggle Challenge) 

Here is the task-
1.	Downloading the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images <br>This dataset contains 6,899 images from 8 distinct classes compiled from various sources (see Acknowledgements). The classes include airplane, car, cat, dog, flower, fruit, motorbike and person. 
3.	Designing a suitable neural-network model to classify these images. 
4.	Randomly selecting 20% of the images as train set, training the model with the rest 80% images. 
5.  Reporting classification accuracy. 
6.  Showing some images that are correctly predicted. Also, showing some images that are not correctly predicted.
